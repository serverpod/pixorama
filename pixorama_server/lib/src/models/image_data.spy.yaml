# By adding the table to the protocol yaml-file we create bindings to the
# database, so that this object can be read and stored. The database code to
# setup the table is saved in the `generated/tables.pgsql` file. We will need
# to manually add the table to the database. Future versions of Serverpod will
# be able to automatically manage database migration and creation of tables.
