# Pixorama
Pixorama is a multi-user pixel editor inspired by r/place. The app demonstrates
the real-time capabilities of Serverpod. It is a complete example and you can
try it out at [https://pixorama.live](https://pixorama.live).

For full Serverpod documentation, please visit
[https://docs.serverpod.dev](https://docs.serverpod.dev).

## Server code
On the server side there are three main files that makes Pixorama tick. Two
serializable objects, found in the [generated](pixorama_server/lib/src/generated)
directory and the
[PixoramaEndpoint](pixorama_server/lib/src/endpoints/pixorama_endpoint.dart)
class. Those files are great starting points for understanding how Pixorama
works.

## Client code
The main Pixorama client/Flutter code can be found in
[Pixorama widget](pixorama_flutter/lib/src/pixorama/pixorama.dart).

## Running the server
To run the server locally, you need to first install Serverpod. Check the
[docs on getting started](https://docs.serverpod.dev).

Next, you need to setup the Docker container and Serverpod & Pixorama database tables:

```bash
cd pixorama_server
docker compose up --build --detach

```

Next, run migrations by typing:

```bash
dart bin/main.dart --role maintenance
```

Finally, start the server by typing:

```bash
dart bin/main.dart
```

In another window, go to pixorama_flutter and then type:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
Flutter will open Chrome and start the Pixorama app.

Select a color from the pallete on the right side, then click on a location in the pixel canvas to the left. The pixel color should change. Open several chrome windows with the same url as that opened by the flutter debugger. Changing a pixel in one window should update all the other the images in the other browser windows, as shown below.

## Hosting the Flutter app with Serverpod
This project demonstrates how to use Serverpod to host a Flutter app. The [deployment-aws.yml](.github/workflows/deployment-aws.yml) file in Github workflows contains the code that will build the web app in CI/CD. You will also need the [build_web](scripts/build_web) script and use the modifications in the server's [server.dart](pixorama_server/lib/server.dart) file.
